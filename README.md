# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
<br />
V. Isualize, CEO of PyBer, has asked us to perform an exploratory analysis on company data. We want to find out how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used to make better business decisions at PyBer. The analysis and visualizations produced will help Pyber improve access to ridesharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.

## Summary 
<br />
* Rural cities' avarage fares are the most expensive. One recommendation is to lower the fare price per distance in rural areas.
<br />
* Increase the price per distance of urban cities' rides since there are more trips and they tend to be shorter. 
<br /> 
* Assign more drivers to rural areas to increase accessibilty.
